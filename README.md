##  Debug
1.  <u>Open social media links not in new tab</U>

Add target="_blank" attribute to the anchor HTML elements for social media icons in the footer section. This ensures that users can follow social media accounts without leaving the main website.

2.  <u>Footer of contact-us page not stay at bottom of the page</u>

Make the height of main section min-height:100vh so footer section will always stay at bottom of the page.

3.  <u>Increase images quality in gallery page and home page</u>

Use AI tool to upscaling: https://imgupscaler.ai.

4.  <u>Contrast between text and background color was not perfect</u>

Change background color from light blue to dark blue.
